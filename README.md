# OCR-Language-Learning

## :zap: About
This is a small, prototype (proof-of-concept) application that attempts to help teach users how to write better English (as in better character shapes, etcetera) using Optical Character Recognition via EasyOCR in Python. I have used the Pygame library for the graphics.

## :desktop_computer: How to run locally
Just clone the repository on your machine, and install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You can use a virtual environment for this. Then just run `main.py` and start!
